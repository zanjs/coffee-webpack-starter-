You may learn it but we don't guarantee its stability.

### Develop

You need a static file server for the HTML files. Personally I suggest using Nginx.

```bash
npm i
gulp dev
```

Build (Pack and optimize assets, add hashes and put entries in `index.html`):

```bash
NODE_ENV=static gulp build # not minified
npm run static

NODE_ENV=ws gulp build
npm run ws
```
